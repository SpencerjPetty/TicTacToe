TIME SPENT: I spent the full 4 hours working on this project

NOTES: If I had more time I would have made the game ending message better and offered the player a chance to play again or close the window.
I also would have found smoother ways to accomplish the things I wanted. This was the first real coding project since my mission, so Im definitely a little out of the loop..
All things considered, I hope you like the solutions I found!
